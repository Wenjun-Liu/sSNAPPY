The processes are annotated as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model. Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Recent curation work has expanded our annotations of normal and disease-associated signaling processes and of the drugs that target them, in particular infections caused by the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses and the host response to infection. New tools support better simultaneous analysis of high-throughput data from multiple sources and the placement of understudied (‘dark’) proteins from analyzed datasets in the context of Reactome’s manually curated pathways.},

  title={CDCA8, targeted by MYBL2, promotes malignant progression and olaparib insensitivity in ovarian cancer},
  abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are effective in treating ovarian cancer. However, cancer cell insensitivity and resistance remain challenges. Determination of the exact chemoresistance mechanisms and potential targeted therapies is urgent. CDCA8 (cell division cycle associated 8) participates in the tumorigenesis of various cancers; however, the exact biological function of CDCA8 in ovarian cancer remains obscure. Here, we found that CDCA8 was overexpressed in ovarian cancer and that high expression of CDCA8 promoted the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, silencing of CDCA8 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to olaparib and cisplatin by inducing G2/M arrest, accelerating apoptosis, increasing DNA damage and interfering with RAD51 accumulation in vitro. In addition, MYBL2 (MYB proto-oncogene-like 2), identified as an upstream transcription factor of CDCA8, was positively correlated with the expression level of CDCA8 in ovarian cancer. Finally, MYBL2 enhanced the aggressive characteristics of ovarian cancer cells by regulating CDCA8. In conclusion, high CDCA8 expression was involved in the tumorigenesis, aggressiveness and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer. CDCA8 silencing combined with olaparib treatment might lead to substantial progress in ovarian cancer targeted therapy.},

	title = {Increased expression of {UBE2T} predicting poor survival of ovarian cancer: based on bioinformatics analysis of {UBE2s}, clinical samples and the {GEO} database},
	abstract = {Background：Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2 (UBE2) have been reported in the microenvironment of various malignant tumors, but their correlation with ovarian cancer remains elusive.
Methods: The Oncomine, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, and STRING databases were used to systematically analyze the expression pattern, prognostic value, genetic variation, and biological function of 12 members of the UBE2 gene family in ovarian cancer. UBE2T exhibited a strong correlation with ovarian cancer and was thus further examined. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), as well as analyses of function and pathway enrichment, somatic mutations, copy number variation, and methylation were performed, and the correlation with immune cell infiltration was examined to explore the mechanism underlying aberrant UBE2T expression. Finally, the expression and prognostic value of UBE2T in ovarian cancer were verified by immunohistochemical evaluation of 131 clinical ovarian samples and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE51088, GSE73614, and GSE63885 datasets) analysis.
Results: The mRNA levels of UBE2C, UBE2N, UBE2S, and UBE2T were significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer compared with those in normal ovarian tissue. In patients with ovarian serous carcinoma, UBE2A, UBE2B, UBE2C, UBE2G, UBE2R2 and UBE2T upregulation were associated with poor overall survival. Moreover, UBE2A, UBE2N, UBE2R2 and UBE2T upregulation and UBE2G downregulation were associated with poor progression-free survival. Immunohistochemistry revealed that UBE2T was significantly upregulated in ovarian malignant tumors compared with that in borderline tumors, benign tumors, and normal ovarian tissues, and its high expression was associated with poor prognosis. The Cox model showed that UBE2T upregulation was an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of ovarian cancer (hazard ratio: 4.095, P=0.029). The above results were verified in the GEO database. In addition, UBE2T was associated with specific immune cells and mainly involved in cell cycle-related events. Genomic analysis showed that TP53 and TTN mutations were associated with UBE2T expression. Gene copy number amplification and hypomethylation may be responsible for UBE2T upregulation in ovarian cancer.Conclusions: UBE2 family members may play a role in the development of ovarian cancer. Specifically, UBE2T could serve as a new prognostic marker and therapeutic target for this disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Survivin belongs to the protein family of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) and is a regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and prognostic signiﬁcance of expression survivin in patients with ovarian cancer. Methods: We systematically searched for articles in PubMed, the American Chemical Society (Publications), Medline, the Royal Society of Chemistry, Scopus and the Web of Science. Patient clinical data, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and survivin expression were extracted from individual studies. We performed statistical analysis using the STATA 16 package. Eighteen publications containing data from 2233 patients with ovarian cancer were included in this meta-analysis. Results: We found an adverse effect of survivin expression on OS (risk ratio (HR): 1.60; 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.33–1.93, p = 0.00) but this was not observed on DFS (HR: 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.55–2.05, p = 0.87). The analysis of clinicopathological parameters showed that survivin expression was associated with the histological grades (G1–2 vs. G3) (odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95\% CI: 0.34–0.83, p = 0.01) and: International Federation Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (I–II vs. III–IV) (OR = 0.22, 95\% CI: 0.09–0.55, p = 0.00), but it was not signiﬁcantly correlated with the histological subtype (OR = 1.14, 95\% CI: 0.83–1.58, p = 0.42). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that survivin expression may be a marker of poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. Survivin expression was associated with parameters of greater aggressiveness of ovarian cancer. Prospective studies are needed to conﬁrm our results indicating that survivin expression can be used as an ovarian cancer biomarker.},

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays an important role in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways. Although sumoylation plays a key role in DNA repair and tumorgenesis, whether Ubc9 is involved in EOC progression remains unknown. In the present study, we constructed Ubc-9 expressed recombined plasmid pEGFP-N1-Ubc9. The mRNA levels of Ubc9 were confirmed in human ovarian cell lines before and after transfection with pEGFP-N1-Ubc9 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted Ubc9 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to observe the effect of Ubc9 on cell proliferation. The protein levels of Ubc9, and proliferation-related signals Akt and physphorylated Akt were determined by Western blot. Our results showed that proliferation of EOC cells increased significantly in Ubc9 overexpressing cells, but decreased in Ubc9 knockdown cells. The physphorylation of Akt showed similar trends. In addition, the inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, LY294002, dramatically inhibited the growth of Ubc9 overexpressing cells. Therefore, Ubc9 gene plays an important role in cell proliferation in EOC through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.},

The order in which the genes appear in the list is a consequence of the biological roles that the genes play within the cell, which account, at molecular scale, for the macroscopic differences observed between the phenotypes studied. Typically, two steps are followed for understanding the biological processes that differentiate phenotypes at molecular level: ﬁrst, genes with signiﬁcant differential expression are selected on the basis of their experimental values and subsequently, the functional properties of these genes are analysed. Instead, we present a simple procedure which combines experimental measurements with available biological information in a way that genes are simultaneously tested in groups related by common functional properties. The method proposed constitutes a very sensitive tool for selecting genes with signiﬁcant differential behaviour in the experimental conditions tested.},

Results: We conduct an extensive survey of statistical approaches for gene set analysis and identify a common modular structure underlying most published methods. Based on this finding we propose a general framework for detecting gene set enrichment. This framework provides a metatheory of gene set analysis that not only helps to gain a better understanding of the relative merits of each embedded approach but also facilitates a principled comparison and offers insights into the relative interplay of the methods.
Conclusion: We use this framework to conduct a computer simulation comparing 261 different variants of gene set enrichment procedures and to analyze two experimental data sets.

Central in this growth and increased use of WikiPathways are the various communities that focus on particular subsets of molecular pathways such as for rare diseases and lipid metabolism. Knowledge from published pathway ﬁgures helps prioritize pathway development, using optical character and named entity recognition. We show the growth of WikiPathways over the last three years, highlight the new communities and collaborations of pathway authors and curators, and describe various technologies to connect to external resources and initiatives. The road toward a sustainable, community-driven pathway database goes through integration with other resources such as Wikidata and allowing more use, curation and redistribution of WikiPathways content.},

	abstract = {Background: Pathway enrichment analysis is extensively used in the analysis of Omics data for gaining biological insights into the functional roles of pre-defined subsets of genes, proteins and metabolites. A large number of methods have been proposed in the literature for this task. The vast majority of these methods use as input expression levels of the biomolecules under study together with their membership in pathways of interest. The latest generation of pathway enrichment methods also leverages information on the topology of the underlying pathways, which as evidence from their evaluation reveals, lead to improved sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, a systematic empirical comparison of such methods is still lacking, making selection of the most suitable method for a specific experimental setting challenging. This comparative study of nine network-based methods for pathway enrichment analysis aims to provide a systematic evaluation of their performance based on three real data sets with different number of features (genes/metabolites) and number of samples.
Results: The findings highlight both methodological and empirical differences across the nine methods. In particular, certain methods assess pathway enrichment due to differences both across expression levels and in the strength of the interconnectedness of the members of the pathway, while others only leverage differential expression levels. In the more challenging setting involving a metabolomics data set, the results show that methods that utilize both pieces of information (with NetGSA being a prototypical one) exhibit superior statistical power in detecting pathway enrichment.
Conclusion: The analysis reveals that a number of methods perform equally well when testing large size pathways, which is the case with genomic data. On the other hand, NetGSA that takes into consideration both differential expression of the biomolecules in the pathway, as well as changes in the topology exhibits a superior performance when testing small size pathways, which is usually the case for metabolomics data.},

	abstract = {Background: Enrichment analysis is a popular approach to identify pathways or sets of genes which are significantly enriched in the context of differentially expressed genes. The traditional gene set enrichment approach considers a pathway as a simple gene list disregarding any knowledge of gene or protein interactions. In contrast, the new group of so called pathway topology-based methods integrates the topological structure of a pathway into the analysis.
Methods: We comparatively investigated gene set and pathway topology-based enrichment approaches, considering three gene set and four topological methods. These methods were compared in two extensive simulation studies and on a benchmark of 36 real datasets, providing the same pathway input data for all methods.
Results: In the benchmark data analysis both types of methods showed a comparable ability to detect enriched pathways. The first simulation study was conducted with KEGG pathways, which showed considerable gene overlaps between each other. In this study with original KEGG pathways, none of the topology-based methods outperformed the gene set approach. Therefore, a second simulation study was performed on non-overlapping pathways created by unique gene IDs. Here, methods accounting for pathway topology reached higher accuracy than the gene set methods, however their sensitivity was lower.
Conclusions: We conducted one of the first comprehensive comparative works on evaluating gene set against pathway topology-based enrichment methods. The topological methods showed better performance in the simulation scenarios with non-overlapping pathways, however, they were not conclusively better in the other scenarios. This suggests that simple gene set approach might be sufficient to detect an enriched pathway under realistic circumstances. Nevertheless, more extensive studies and further benchmark data are needed to systematically evaluate these methods and to assess what gain and cost pathway topology information introduces into enrichment analysis. Both types of methods for enrichment analysis require further improvements in order to deal with the problem of pathway overlaps.},

	abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression proﬁles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular proﬁling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and ﬂexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in diﬀerential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.
Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

	abstract = {Background: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple element like a gene/ protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables topology-based gene set analyses. Unfortunately, currently available R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases. They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not differentiate between complexes and gene families.
Results: Here we present graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information from four different databases is interpreted following specific biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is available as part of the Bioconductor software suite.
Conclusions: graphite is an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements.},

To characterize chemotherapy resistance processes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, we prospectively collected tissue samples before and after chemotherapy and analyzed their transcriptomic profiles at a single-cell resolution. After removing patient-specific signals by a novel analysis approach, PRIMUS, we found a consistent increase in stress-associated cell state during chemotherapy, which was validated by RNA in situ hybridization and bulk RNA sequencing. The stress-associated state exists before chemotherapy, is subclonally enriched during the treatment, and associates with poor progression-free survival. Co-occurrence with an inflammatory cancer–associated fibroblast subtype in tumors implies that chemotherapy is associated with stress response in both cancer cells and stroma, driving a paracrine feed-forward loop. In summary, we have found a resistant state that integrates stromal signaling and subclonal evolution and offers targets to overcome chemotherapy resistance.

Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade’s worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GCcontent) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

L¨onnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of diﬀerential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of L¨onnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coeﬃcients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot ﬁltering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

The pooled estimates logarithm with standard error logarithm of odds ratio and relative risk with confidence interval were calculated.
Results: This study revealed that there is association between ATM variants and the risk of breast cancer; according to the seven adjusted case-control studies, OR of this association was estimated as 1.67 (95\%CI: 0.73–3.82), according to nine unadjusted case-control studies, the crude OR was 2.27 (95\% CI: 1.17–4.40) and according to two cohorts, the RR was estimated as 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.17–2.40).

Thereby, it imposes upon itself the need for a very large number of permutations when small P-values are to be accurately estimated. This is computationally expensive and often infeasible.Results: A method of computing P-values based on tail approximation is presented. The tail of the distribution of permutation values is approximated by a generalized Pareto distribution. A good fit and thus accurate P-value estimates can be obtained with a drastically reduced number of permutations when compared with the standard empirical way of computing P-values.Availability: The Matlab code can be obtained from the corresponding author on request.Contact:  tknijnenburg@systemsbiology.orgSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Its popularity has led to an explosion of both enrichment methods and pathway databases. While the elegance of pathway enrichment lies in its simplicity, multiple factors can impact the results of such an analysis, which may not be accounted for. Researchers may fail to give influential aspects their due, resorting instead to popular methods and gene set collections, or default settings. Despite ongoing efforts to establish set guidelines, meaningful results are still hampered by a lack of consensus or gold standards around how enrichment analysis should be conducted. Nonetheless, such concerns have prompted a series of benchmark studies specifically focused on evaluating the influence of various factors on pathway enrichment results. In this review, we organize and summarize the findings of these benchmarks to provide a comprehensive overview on the influence of these factors. Our work covers a broad spectrum of factors, spanning from methodological assumptions to those related to prior biological knowledge, such as pathway definitions and database choice. In doing so, we aim to shed light on how these aspects can lead to insignificant, uninteresting or even contradictory results. Finally, we conclude the review by proposing future benchmarks as well as solutions to overcome some of the challenges, which originate from the outlined factors.}",

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms.

    abstract = { Abstract Investigators require intuitive tools to rationalize complex datasets generated by transcriptional profiling experiments. Pathway analysis methods, in which differentially expressed genes are mapped to databases of reference pathways to facilitate assessment of relative enrichment, lead investigators more effectively to biologically testable hypotheses. However, once a set of differentially expressed genes is isolated, pathway analysis approaches tend to ignore rich gene expression information and, moreover, do not exploit relationships between transcripts. In this article, we report the development of a new method in which both pathway topology and the magnitude of gene expression changes inform the scoring system, thereby providing a powerful filter in the enrichment of biologically relevant information. When four sample datasets were evaluated with this method, literature mining confirmed that those pathways germane to the physiological process under investigation were highlighted by our method relative to z-score overrepresentation calculations. Moreover, non-relevant processes were downgraded using the method described herein. The inclusion of expression and topological data in the calculation of a pathway regulation score (PRS) facilitated discrimination of key processes in real biological datasets. Specifically, by combining fold-change data for those transcripts exceeding a significance threshold, and by taking into account the potential for altered gene expression to impact upon downstream transcription, one may readily identify those pathways most relevant to pathophysiological processes. }

It reduces complexity and provides a system-level view of changes in cellular activity in response to treatments and/or in disease states. Methods that use existing pathway network information have been shown to outperform simpler methods that only take into account pathway membership. However, despite significant progress in understanding the association amongst members of biological pathways, and expansion of data bases containing information about interactions of biomolecules, the existing network information may be incomplete or inaccurate and is not cell-type or disease condition-specific.Results: We propose a constrained network estimation framework that combines network estimation based on cell- and condition-specific high-dimensional Omics data with interaction information from existing data bases. The resulting pathway topology information is subsequently used to provide a framework for simultaneous testing of differences in expression levels of pathway members, as well as their interactions. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed network estimator and the test for pathway enrichment, and investigate its small sample performance in simulated and real data settings.Availability and Implementation: The proposed method has been implemented in the R-package netgsa available on CRAN.Contact:  jinma@upenn.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many high-throughput experiments compare two
              phenotypes such as disease vs. healthy, with the goal of
              understanding the underlying biological phenomena characterizing
              the given phenotype. Because of the importance of this type of
              analysis, more than 70 pathway analysis methods have been
              proposed so far. These can be categorized into two main
              categories: non-topology-based (non-TB) and topology-based (TB).
              Although some review papers discuss this topic from different
              aspects, there is no systematic, large-scale assessment of such
              methods. Furthermore, the majority of the pathway analysis
              approaches rely on the assumption of uniformity of p values under
              the null hypothesis, which is often not true. RESULTS: This
              article presents the most comprehensive comparative study on
              pathway analysis methods available to date. We compare the actual
              performance of 13 widely used pathway analysis methods in over
              1085 analyses. These comparisons were performed using 2601
              samples from 75 human disease data sets and 121 samples from 11
              knockout mouse data sets. In addition, we investigate the extent
              to which each method is biased under the null hypothesis.
              Together, these data and results constitute a reliable benchmark
              against which future pathway analysis methods could and should be
              tested. CONCLUSION: Overall, the result shows that no method is
              perfect. In general, TB methods appear to perform better than
              non-TB methods. This is somewhat expected since the TB methods
              take into consideration the structure of the pathway which is
              meant to describe the underlying phenomena. We also discover that
              most, if not all, listed approaches are biased and can produce
              skewed results under the null.",

The protein was identified as a product of the murine double minute 2 gene (mdm-2). The mdm-2 gene enhances the tumorigenic potential of cells when it is overexpressed and encodes a putative transcription factor. To determine if mdm-2 could modulate p53 transactivation, a p53-responsive element from the muscle creatine kinase gene was employed. A wild-type p53-expressing plasmid enhanced the expression of the p53-responsive element when cotransfected into cells that contain no endogenous p53. When a cosmid expressing mdm-2 was transfected with this p53-expressing plasmid, the transactivation of the p53-responsive element was inhibited. Thus, a product of the mdm-2 oncogene forms a tight complex with the p53 protein, and the mdm-2 oncogene can inhibit p53-mediated transactivation.}

The protein product of the haploinsufficient mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene binds to and inhibits the p53 protein. Recent studies of human genetic variants in p53 and MDM2 have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect p53 signaling, confer cancer risk, and suggest that the pathway is under evolutionary selective pressure (               1                                             \textendash{}               4               ). In this report, we analyze the haplotype structure of MDM4, a structural homolog of MDM2, in several different human populations. Unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the haplotype distribution of MDM4 indicate the presence of candidate SNPs that may also modify the efficacy of the p53 pathway. Association studies in 5 different patient populations reveal that these SNPs in MDM4 confer an increased risk for, or early onset of, human breast and ovarian cancers in Ashkenazi Jewish and European cohorts, respectively. This report not only implicates MDM4 as a key regulator of tumorigenesis in the human breast and ovary, but also exploits for the first time evolutionary driven linkage disequilibrium as a means to select SNPs of p53 pathway genes that might be clinically relevant.},

Methods: Bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and gene expres\- sion omnibus (GEO) cohorts was used to illustrate the relationship between GADD45B expression and metastasis, as well as the survival time of EOC. GADD45B was down\- regulated by siRNAs in EOC cells, and migration ability was determined by a transwell assay and wound-healing assay. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) path\- way enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted to discover the downstream pathway of GADD45B. The regulation of epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT) by GADD45B was verified by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Finally, the correlation of GADD45B expression with EOC metastasis was investigated in EOC tissues by immunohistochemistry. Results: Overexpression of GADD45B indicates shorter overall survival time and progres\- sion-free survival time, and it is an independent risk factor for poor survival in EOC patients. Elevated GADD45B is related to venous invasion, lymphatic invasion and peritoneal carci\- nomatosis. Downregulation of GADD45B decreases the migration of ES2 and SKOV3 cells. Further KEGG enrichment analysis and GSEA revealed that EMT may be the downstream pathway of GADD45B. In addition, reduced GADD45B increases the expression of E-cadherin and decreases that of N-cadherin and vimentin. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of GADD45B expression revealed that the expression of GADD45B in omental metastatic tissues was higher than that in matched primary ovarian cancer tissues. These results suggest that elevated GADD45B promotes the motility of ovarian cancer cells through EMT and is associated with EOC metastasis. Conclusion: GADD45B can promote the motility of ovarian cancer cells through EMT, is associated with EOC metastasis, and may be a new biomarker of metastasis and prognosis.},

The function of Gadd45 as a stress sensor is mediated via a complex interplay of physical interactions with other cellular proteins implicated in cell cycle regulation and the response of cells to stress, notably PCNA, p21, cdc2/cyclinB1, and the p38 and JNK stress response kinases. Altered expression of Gadd45 has been observed in multiple types of solid tumors as well as in hematopoietic malignancies.
